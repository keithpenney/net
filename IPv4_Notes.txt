Internet Protocol v4 Packet Notes

IPv4:
-----
  When a datagram is sent over IPv4, the full packet (at the "Internet Layer") is 20-bytes in length (or greater).
  If the 'IHL' (see below) is > 5, the header length is 4*IHL bytes (octets) long.
  The structure follows:
  Header:
  -------
    | IP Header (>=20B) | Payload |
     ____/\___________________________________________________________________________________________
    /                                                                                                 \
    | Version (4b) | IHL (4b) | DSCP (6b) | ECN (2b) | Total Length (16b) | ID (16b) | Flags (3b) |
      Fragment Offset (13b) | TTL (8b) | Protocol (8b) | Header Checksum (16b) | Source IP Addr (32b) |
      Dest IP Addr (32b) | [Options ((IHL-5)*32b)] |

    Field Name      Length (bits)   Description
    -------------------------------------------
    Version         4               IP Protocol Version. Always '4' for IPv4
    IHL             4               IP Header Length (in 32b increments). Min 5, max 15.
    DSCP            6               Differentiated Services Code Point. Used for specialized service (i.e. VoIP)
    ECN             2               Explicit Congestion Notification. Optional feature.
    Total Length    16              The entire packet size in bytes.  Min = 20. Max = 65535
    Identification  16              Primarily used for keeping track of fragmented datagrams.
    Flags           3               Bitmask: Bit 0 = Rsvd; Bit 1 = "Don't Fragment" (DF); Bit 2 = "More Fragments" (MF)
    Fragment Offset 13              For fragmented packets, holds the offset from beginning in 8-byte increments.
    Time to Live    8               Specifies the time (in "hops") for the packet to survive.
    Protocol        8               This is the protocol number (e.g. TCP = 6, UDP = 17).  See /etc/protocols.
    Header Checksum 16              Every router computes the checksum of the header and compares it with this value.
    Source IP Addr  32              IPv4 address of sender (field can be changed by Network Address Translation)
    Dest IP Addr    32              IPv4 address of recipient (field can be changed by Network Address Translation)
    Options         (IHL-5)*32      Additional options present if IHL>5

  Variable Header Size:
  ---------------------
    The IPv4 header size is variable to provide additional "options" before the packet data.  This feature is not
    often used and may be treated as a vulnerability by some cybersecurity policies; thus packets containing options
    may be dropped/blocked.  The "options" field has its own syntax which will not be covered here.
    The main takeaway is that offsets to all header fields is fixed while (byte) offset to payload is 4*IHL.

  Fragmentation:
  --------------
    If a packet is too large for some node in a link to handle, it can optionally be fragmented into smaller packets.
    If the "Don't Fragment" (DF) bit in the Flags field is set and fragmentation must occur at a node, the packet is
    dropped.  The DF flag can be used if, for instance, a host does not have the resources to fragment/reassemble a
    packet.  For a packet that has been fragmented into N packets ("sub-packets"), each "sub-packet" up to the N-1th
    will have its "More Fragments" (MF) bit set in the Flags field.  The Nth sub-packet will have MF cleared, but will
    have a non-zero Fragment Offset field to distinguish it from a non-fragmented packet.

    To reassemble a fragmented packet, the "Fragment Offset" field is used.  Each sub-packet will have a non-zero offset
    (measured in 8-byte increments).  The sub-packets can then arrive in any order and the packet can be reconstructed
    completely.  If a single sub-packet is dropped or corrupted, data corruption will occur.  But because of the offset
    feature (rather than a 'packet number' feature), the corruption is localized to the space of that sub-packet.  This
    may leave other portions of the original packet useable.

  Time-to-Live (TTL):
  -------------------
    The "Time to Live" (TTL) field is documented as the time in seconds for a packet to survive before it is dropped
    (to prevent cascading network failure due to congestion).  In practice, each router in the route decrements the TTL
    of each packet before transmitting to the next node.  If the TTL value reaches 0, the packet is dropped.  This can
    be used to measure hops in the transport. When a packet is dropped, the router typically sends an "ICMP Time Exceeded"
    message to the sender.
