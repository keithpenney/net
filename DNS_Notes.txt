Domain Name Service/System Notes
--------------------------------

General:
--------
  DNS queries/responses can be carried over numerous transport protocols.

  DNS-over-TCP/UDP (Do53):
  ------------------------
    DNS can be transported in both TCP and UDP payloads.
    Both methods suffer from the shortcoming of lack of encryption/authentication, with UDP also
    being limited by unreliable delivery and packet length restrictions.
    When DNS is transported over UDP, a DNS server listens for queries at the reserved UDP port 53.
    UDP/TCP request/response are single-packet clear-text. For UDP exchange, when the length of the
    answer exceeds 512 bytes, Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS) can be used.

  DNS-over-TLS (DoT):
  -------------------
    DNS-over-TLS servers listen on TCP port 853.  Encryption is supported, but not mandatory.

  DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH):
  ---------------------
    DNS query data can be carried within HTTPS packets (HTTP transported over TLS).  Uses TCP port 443,
    like other HTTPS traffic.

  DNS over QUIC (DoQ):
  --------------------
    Using the QUIC transport protocol, this method achieves privacy characteristic of DoT with latency
    characteristic of DNS over UDP.

Related Unix Commands/Applications:
-----------------------------------
  $ nslookup DOMAIN [DNS_SERVER]

TLS = Transport Layer Security
QUIC = (originally stood for Quick UDP Internet Connections, but now doesn't stand for anything)
DNSCrypt = An alternate protocol that uses TCP/UDP port 443, the same as encrypted HTTPS traffic.
